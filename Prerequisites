Before installation, make sure you have the following:

1. Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. pip (Python package installer) installed.
3. Git installed for cloning the repository.
4. A code editor such as VSCode, Sublime Text, or PyCharm.

Step 1: Clone the Repository
Open your terminal (Command Prompt, Git Bash, or equivalent) and run the following command to clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/PournimaTivatane12/PII-Data-Masking-Forms.git

Change into the project directory:
cd PII-Data-Masking-Forms

Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment
It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. You can create one by running the following commands:

python -m venv venv

Activate the virtual environment:

Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

Step 4: Configure Environment Variables
If your application uses environment variables for sensitive data (e.g., API keys, thresholds), create a .env file in the root directory of the project:


touch .env
Inside the .env file, define any necessary variables. Example:


MASKING_THRESHOLD=10
Step 5: Run the Application
Once everything is set up, you can run the application locally using:


python app.py

Alternatively, if you have a different entry point for the application, adjust the command to fit the appropriate filename.

Step 6: Access the Application
Open your web browser and navigate to:

http://localhost:5000

(or whatever port your application is configured to run on) to view the PII Data Masking Forms.

Step 7: Deploy (Optional)
You can deploy the application to platforms like Glitch, Heroku, Cyclic, or any cloud service of your choice. Follow the deployment instructions of the respective platform.

Additional Notes:

Update the README.md in the repository with any changes to the installation process.
Regularly push updates to GitHub to keep your code up to date.
